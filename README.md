# Twimba - Twitter-like Web Application

Twimba is a simple web application that allows users to post tweets, reply to tweets, and interact with tweets by liking or retweeting them. The current user is considered to be `@Krishna`, and the other users' tweets and replies are imported from a `data.js` file. This project utilizes local storage to persist data across sessions.

## Features

- Post new tweets as the current user `@Krishna`.
- Like and retweet tweets. Retweeting here just modifies the numbers.
- View and post replies to tweets.
- Delete own tweets and replies.
- Persist data using local storage.
